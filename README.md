# A GUI-based system to analyse Steel Structures for Beams

> This is a project I worked on during my 3rd year at the university when I was taking a course called **Steel and Timber Design**. <br>
>
>I volunteered to build a gui system Python(Tkinter) which can do the following: 
>
>
> - Select a suitable steel beam section
> - Classsify the section. Talk about the nature of the web and flange. 
> - Determine the Maximum Moment
> - Determine the Maximum Shear Force
> - Check for Shear
>
>To  run the code :
> - Clone this repository by typing ```git clone https://github.com/Blessing988/Steel_Design.git``` <br>
> in your terminal
> - Run the ```Steel_Design_UI.exe``` file to start the app
